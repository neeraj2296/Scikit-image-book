### What is this book about?

In this short book, we illustrate some of the core algorithms/functions of this popular Python library for image processing and manipulation tasks, with hands-on code examples.

You can think of `scikit-image` as the **first essential library to get familiar with, if you want to work in the field of computer vision/ image processing**.

### Examples from the Scikit-image website

All the examples in this book are directly from the [Scikit-image website](http://scikit-image.org/). I have merely enhanced the code with comments and put them together in a single, navigable manner. 

The code examples are used here under the terms of the **BSD-license of the scikit-image project**.

### Built using `Jupyter-book`

This book has been built and published using the [Jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/start/overview.html) tool. It is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material.
